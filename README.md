# mojoapp

This is a very short (and buggy) app visualizing negative feelings.

It was built as an addition to an experimental project with design students at fhws in a joint course. 
The basic idea was a futuristic device that allows you to control your emotions, the app then would allow you to control the device by counteracting your current negative feeling.

Just keep in mind that this app is of artistic nature. :D
